Keylogger Overview:

This Python script serves as a keylogger, capturing keyboard inputs and storing them securely in an encrypted log file. It utilizes the 'pynput' library to monitor keystrokes and the 'cryptography' library to encrypt the captured data.

Functionality:

    Initialization:
        1. Upon execution, the script checks for the presence of the 'pynput' and 'cryptography' libraries. If not found, it installs them automatically.
        2. It generates a unique encryption key using the Fernet symmetric encryption algorithm and stores it securely in a hidden directory (~/.hidden_dir).

    Encryption and Decryption:
        The script defines functions for encrypting and decrypting messages using the generated encryption key. This ensures that captured keystrokes are securely stored and can only be accessed with the correct key.

    Key Logging:
        1. Using the pynput library, the script listens for keyboard events, capturing each keystroke as it occurs.
        2. When a key is pressed, the script encrypts the key value and appends it to the encrypted log file (~/.hidden_dir/keylog_encrypted.txt).
        3. Special keys are ignored to focus only on alphanumeric characters and symbols.

    Termination:
        The keylogging process continues until the user presses the Escape key, at which point the script stops listening for keystrokes and terminates gracefully.

    Security Measures:
        1. The encryption key is stored in a hidden directory to prevent unauthorized access.
        2. The log file containing encrypted keystrokes is also stored in this hidden directory, ensuring that sensitive data remains protected.

Usage:

To use the keylogger, simply execute the script. It will run silently in the background, capturing keystrokes until terminated by pressing the Escape key. The encrypted log file can then be decrypted using the provided encryption key.

Decryptor Overview:

This Python script complements the keylogger script by providing functionality to decrypt the captured keystrokes. It reads the encrypted log file generated by the keylogger, decrypts each entry using the encryption key, and prints the decrypted keystrokes to the console.

Functionality:

    Encryption Key Loading:
        1. The script defines a function load_encryption_key() to retrieve the encryption key stored in the encryption_key.txt file within the hidden directory (~/.hidden_dir).
        2. This function reads the key from the file and returns it.

    Decrypting Keystrokes:
        1. After loading the encryption key, the script initializes a Fernet cipher object using the key.
        2. It reads the encrypted log file (keylog_encrypted.txt) from the hidden directory.
        3. Each line of the file is decrypted using the cipher, converting the encrypted byte string back into a readable string.
        4. The decrypted keystrokes are printed to the console, removing any trailing newline characters.

Usage:

To decrypt the captured keystrokes, execute the script. It will load the encryption key, decrypt the log file, and print the decrypted keystrokes to the console. This provides visibility into the captured data for analysis or further processing.

Security Measures:

    1. The script accesses the encryption key securely from the hidden directory, ensuring that only authorized users can decrypt the log file.
    2. Decrypted keystrokes are printed to the console, allowing users to view the captured data without compromising its security.

Ethical Considerations:

It's crucial to use this tool responsibly and ethically. Keyloggers can potentially infringe on privacy rights if used without consent. Ensure that you have the appropriate permissions before deploying this script and respect the privacy of others.
